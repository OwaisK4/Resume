# Resume

## About 📄

This repository contains the source code from my `Overleaf` project that was used to generate my resume. ✒️

I am uploading it to here for version control purposes and to make it public for use. 🌍

### Inspiration

This resume itself is based on [Deedy's CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz), but introduces slight variation with font family, font size, color, spacing, 2 column grid size, headings/subheadings visual.

Much thanks to Deedy. 👋

## How To Use 🛠️

The _generated PDF_ can be found and download from `dist/`.

If you like to be more interactive, please **download** the PDF and **hover** your mouse over the bolded text or generally just hover over the blue text on the resume. The links are in `SkyBlue`.

## Getting Started 🏎

To use this template for **_your own resume_**,

1. Clone this project to your machine with `git clone https://github.com/Rubix982/Resume.git`, or download repository as ZIP
2. Start a blank [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) project by first making an account
3. Upload from your **local machine** to the **Overleaf** project the following contents _only_,
    1. The **fonts** folder. Do this by creating the same hierarchy with `Create Folder` on Overleaf, and upload the files as per organized
    2. The `openfont.cls` file. Create a file on `Overleaf` with this name, and copy over the contents
    3. The `resume.tex` file. Same as above
4. Click on `Menu` button on the top-left (screenshot #1) and change the default `pdfLaTeX` to `LuaLaTeX` in the `Compiler` option under `Settings` (screenshot #2)
5. Click anywhere on the `editor`, and press `Ctrl+S`. This will generate the current resume as can be seen in [Generated Resume](#generated-resume)
6. Make the necessary changes. You will only ever need to modify `resume.tex`. If you feel confident enough, you can modify `openfont.cls` to adjust fonts, font size, colors, etc
7. When you're done making the necessary changes, press `Ctrl+S` to generate the output. Keep making changes until satisfaction
8. Enjoy!
